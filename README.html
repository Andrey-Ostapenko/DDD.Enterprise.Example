<h1>NES.RavenDB.Example</h1>

<p>An example of getting NES configured and running with NServicebus, RavenDB, and NEventStore</p>

<p>Follows DDD, CQRS, EventSourcing patterns</p>

<p>I spent several hours of my life having to dig deep into these projects to figure this out - passing on the info to those with less time of their hands.</p>

<p><strong>Architecture Overview</strong></p>

<p>There are currently 3 nservicebus endpoints.  One to send demo commands in SendMessages, one to receive commands in Domain and an event handler in Application.</p>

<p>The Domain endpoint is configured to be a distributor to event listeners and Application is configured to subscribe.</p>

<p>In a production system you would configure a seperate distributor to distribute commands to your command handlers (domain projects), and another distributor to send events to event handlers (application projects).</p>

<p>You could even make seperate queues for different bounded contexts.</p>

<p>In theory you can have multiple different Domains and multiple Application handlers (and I would suggest you do)</p>

<p><strong>Project References</strong></p>

<p>Its important to note that the Domain project is referencing all Domain.* projects, similarly the Application project is referencing all Application.* projects.
Each Domain.* and Application.* project represents a bounded context.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<p>Start visual studio as admin because NServicebus likes it that way</p>

<p>Configure the debugger to launch 3 projects, Domain, Application, and DemoMessages</p>

<p>Run each first by itself so NServicebus can create the MSMQ queues</p>

<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>

<p>A couple things should be said about the structure of the solution.</p>

<p>The project mimics the standard DDD layers</p>

<ul>
<li>Presentation</li>
<li>Application</li>
<li>Domain</li>
<li>Data Access</li>
<li>Persistence</li>
</ul>

<p>We are modeling the top 3 layers in this solution.  NEventStore and RavenDB handle Data Access and Persistence.
In each folder you will find 1 'master' project and a child.  IE</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Domain/</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Domain.csproj
    Domain.Inventory.csproj</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The purpose of the Domain project is simply to be an NServicebus endpoint.  You can configure your own endpoints however you like.</p>

<p>The Domain.* projects should represent your bounded contexts.  Same with the Application.* projects.</p>

<p>Inside the domain projects I create a folder for every aggregate root.  Some projects create a root Events and Commands folder - 
however for many aggregate roots this easily gets out of hand.</p>

<p>Each folder has a sub folder for Events and Commands specific to the aggregate root.  Also inside the folder is the aggregate root command handler 
and the aggregate root itself.</p>

<p>I decided on this structure because it keeps things very nicely organized - how you do it is up to you.</p>

<p>For the application projects, I simply have a Handlers folder and a Models folder to model all the read models for that bounded context.</p>

<p>For larger deployments I am sure that structure will change to group read models somehow.</p>
